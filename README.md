## Description

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning in order to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used to analyse image data. Transfer learning is a technique that allows to reuse a model across different tasks. The objective is that given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. If the algorithm can't identify the image as a human or dog, it will say so.

Here are a [Medium](https://caiokinupp.medium.com/how-to-build-a-dog-breed-classifier-using-cnn-and-transfer-learning-5f73cfe27288) blog post explain the project.

## Contents

The project is divided into 7 steps:

- Intro
- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dog
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 5: Write Your Algorithm
- Step 6: Test Your Algorithm
